@article{Lara2013,
abstract = {Providing accurate and opportune information on people's activities and behaviors is one of the most important tasks in pervasive computing. Innumerable applications can be visualized, for instance, in medical, security, entertainment, and tactical scenarios. Despite human activity recognition (HAR) being an active field for more than a decade, there are still key aspects that, if addressed, would constitute a significant turn in the way people interact with mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art in HAR based on wearable sensors. A general architecture is first presented along with a description of the main components of any HAR system. We also propose a two-level taxonomy in accordance to the learning approach (either supervised or semi-supervised) and the response time (either offline or online). Then, the principal issues and challenges are discussed, as well as the main solutions to each one of them. Twenty eight systems are qualitatively evaluated in terms of recognition performance, energy consumption, obtrusiveness, and flexibility, among others. Finally, we present some open problems and ideas that, due to their high relevance, should be addressed in future research.},

@article{Sama2013,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel gait recognition method which uses the signals measured by a single inertial sensor located on the waist. This method considers human gait as a dynamical system and employs a few singular values obtained by means of Singular Spectrum Analysis applied to scalar measurements from the inertial sensor. Singular values can be interpreted as the approximate edge length of the bounding box wrapping the attractor in the latent space. Effects of different parameters on the gait recognition performance using patterns from 20 different subjects are analysed. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Frank2010,
abstract = {Activity recognition based on data from mobile wearable devices is becoming an important application area for machine learning. We propose a novel approach based on a combination of feature extraction using time-delay embedding and supervised learning. The computational requirements are considerably lower than existing approaches, so the processing can be done in real time on a low-powered portable device such as a mobile phone. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on a large, noisy data set comprising over 50 hours of data from six different subjects, including activities such as running and walking up or down stairs. We also demonstrate the ability of the system to accurately classify an individual from a set of 25 people, based only on the characteristics of their walking gait. The system requires very little parameter tuning, and can be trained with small amounts of data.},

@article{Uzal2011,
abstract = {In this work we propose an objective function to guide the search for a state space reconstruction of a dynamical system from a time series of measurements. These statistics can be evaluated on any reconstructed attractor, thereby allowing a direct comparison among different approaches: (uniform or nonuniform) delay vectors, PCA, Legendre coordinates, etc. It can also be used to select the most appropriate parameters of a reconstruction strategy. In the case of delay coordinates this translates into finding the optimal delay time and embedding dimension from the absolute minimum of the advocated cost function. Its definition is based on theoretical arguments on noise amplification, the complexity of the reconstructed attractor, and a direct measure of local stretch which constitutes an irrelevance measure. The proposed method is demonstrated on synthetic and experimental time series.},
