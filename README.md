> "I believe that any scientific endeavour that aims to advance the knowledge of 
humankind can only be possible by making our contributions explicitly replicable."

With that in mind, I am putting all my efforts, from January 2017, to do both [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and [Replicated Science](http://rescience.github.io/).
