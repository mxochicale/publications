Towards the Quantification of Human-Robot Imitation Using Wearable Inertial Sensors
=============
Author keywords:

#### Abstract:
In this study, we propose a metric in order to quantify how closely a healthy participant imitates a robot,
for which we use inertial sensors attached to both individual participant and to a humanoid-robot.
For the experiment, twelve healthy participants were invited to perform
simple arm movements in order to apply
the state space reconstruction which
is based on the method of time-delay embedding and PCA.
Although the performed arm movements of the healthy participants were very simple,
the study reveals that the participants showed different ranges of the proposed metric
that can be linked to the level of imitation.
Such a metric can be improved in order to determine
a detailed scoring of human-robot imitation
during training or rehabilitation activities.

## Submission Instructions

Authors are asked to submit their LBRs as a 2-page article (including references and figures), in ACM double-column format. Authors are encouraged to consult prior years’ submissions to understand the format, and further guidelines and Word/LaTeX templates can be found at: http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2017/authors/guide-to-submission-types/. Submit your paper through the “paper submission and review” website.

Publications should be fully anonymized at time of submission. Please see anonymization guidelines here: http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2017/authors/guidelines-for-anonymizing-submissions/

Due to a tight publication deadline with the publisher, all submitted abstracts should be “camera-ready” at time of submission. In other words: proof read, spell checked, etc.

## Call For Late-Breaking Reports

The 12th Annual ACM/IEEE HRI Conference theme is “Smart Interaction”, following Vienna’s “Smart City” initiative. The conference seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, methodological, behavioral, and theoretical, that advance fundamental and applied knowledge and methods in human-robot interaction.

The Late-Breaking Reports (LBR) venue at HRI provides authors with the opportunity to present cutting-edge and experimental research results to the community. It is also an excellent opportunity for researchers new to the field to participate in the conference.

All LBR submissions will be lightly peer-reviewed, and published in the companion proceedings of the conference, which will appear in both the ACM Digital Library and IEEExplore. Authors will retain the copyright of their work, and can submit it to other venues. LBRs will be presented at a poster session during HRI 2017.
