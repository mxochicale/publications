Abstract:	We present a preliminary experiment to understand the variability of six simple movements. Six participants, wearing inertial measurement units on their wrist, performed six actions. The data collected were analysed using time-delay embedding theorem, PCA and percentage of cumulative energy to characterise variability in these movements. Of these movements, circular and 8-shape movements show a constant trend between participants; however, such a trend is not evident for static, horizontal, vertical and diagonal movements. Such analysis can be useful in determining different states of interactions with the display of userâ€™s behavior (enthusiasm, boredom, tiredness or confusion) over the course of training, practice or rehabilitation.
