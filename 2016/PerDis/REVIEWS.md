Review
Review:	The work presents a preliminary study that investigates variances in the users' performance of simple motions. The study was conducted with six users who had to perform 6 different gestures each for 20 seconds. Data was provided by inertial tracking devices. The authors analyse the data by combining time-delay embedding, principle component analysis and percentage of cumulative energy.

The overall layout of the poster is simplistic and clear. The contents are easy to follow.
However, the main motivation of the study is not entirely clear to me. In the abstract, the work is motivated by mentioning rehabilitation. This is not explained any further. In the conclusion, interpreting the users' movements during interaction with pervasive displays and making systems react accordingly is described, which seems like a better motivation to start with.
Figure 1 in the extended abstract (figure 2 in the poster) is a nice and clear depiction of the gestures. The visualization of the data is useful, however, a short interpretation of the graphs would have been nice. Figure 2 in the extended abstract (figure 1 in the poster) does not really speak for itself and does not convey much information with its current depiction. I think it should be either omitted or extended to replace the frameworks section.
In the conclusion, the authors state that the results could not have been obtained with PCA alone. However, the authors do not explicitly explain, what exactly PCA lacks to yield insightful results. This should be made more clear.
The poster and extended abstract need some proofreading, since there are some typos and grammar mistakes.

Overall, I consider the results and the described uses in the conclusion/outlook promising. I encourage the authors to conduct a similar study in the future on a bigger scale to yield more reliable results.

Review
Review:	The authors present their work on the variability of mid-air gestures. They frame their work in the context of rehabilitation. Analysis of gestures using PCA should help getting insights into variability.

The presented approach and work is interesting. Most work on mid-air gestures and motion focusses either on recognising a discrete set of gestures or creating taxonomies of the same. Focusing on the inter-gesture variability is an interesting approach and I can see applications in terms of recognition as well as rehabilitation, as framed by the authors.

The authors should include more of their results as well as discussion in the paper. Having a metric on variability would be interesting, also some insights into how variability is different across their participants.

Furthermore, the poster should not be a pure replication of the abstract but more include the most interesting points (also visible from a distance) to allow for good readability as well as grasping the main idea of the poster in 10 seconds. The authors should include a more visually pleasing and structured version of the poster in the final version. Additionally, the authors used the wrong template for the abstract.

In general, I am positive about accepting this poster since it explores an interesting topic, and will probably lead to interesting discussions at the conference.

The reviewers were positive about this work. The authors should address the feedback in the final version of the work. Using the correct template for the abstract will give them more space for including the missing information (motivation, results).
