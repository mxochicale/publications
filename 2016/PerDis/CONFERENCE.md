The Fifth ACM International Symposium on Pervasive Displays will take place in
June 2016 in Oulu, Finland. 

 The symposium on Pervasive Displays welcomes work
on all areas pertaining to digital displays including, but not limited to:

    Applications
    Content design
    Evaluations, case studies, deployments and experience reports
    Interfaces and interaction techniques
    Novel technologies and new forms of pervasive display
    System architectures and infrastructure
    Research methods for pervasive displays
    Media facades and architecture
    Art installations

We invite you to begin planning your submissions and participation for PerDis 2016! 



Posters

The poster track presents an opportunity to publish late-breaking results,
technical descriptions, smaller research contributions, and works-in-progress in
a concise format. Accepted posters will be displayed in a designated session,
providing presenters with an opportunity to engage in discussions with other
attendees around their research.


Authors are required to submit an abstract and draft poster. Poster abstracts
should be a maximum of two (2) pages in ACM SIGCHI format, clearly describing
the research questions addressed, research methods and tasks, findings or
results, and the contribution to the pervasive displays community. Abstracts
should also provide sufficient background and related work to situate and
contextualize the authors work within the greater body of research. As the
abstract may be viewed without the poster, this should be written to stand alone
as an independent submission. Draft posters should be formatted for A1 portrait
(594mmx841mm).

Submissions should consist of original work not been previously published or
concurrently under consideration for any other conference, workshop, journal, or
other publication with an ISBN, ISSN or DOI number.

All submissions (and supplementary material) should not be anonymized and will
be reviewed by an international panel of experts in the field of pervasive
displays. All accepted abstracts will be archived in the ACM Digital Library.

Submit here.
