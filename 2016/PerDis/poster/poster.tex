\headerbox{Problem}{name=problem,column=0,row=0}{
Variability is an inherent characteristic of human movement \cite{newell93}.
Generally, humans perform the same action slightly differently trial by trial.
For these reasons we are interested in studying methods that can give insight 
into the variability between individuals and between repetitions of the same movement. 
Movement variability is presented when users interact with displays \cite{zaiti15}.
However, we consider that inertial sensors offer both comfortable and unconstrained 
interaction with displays in order to understand movement variability.

We believe that this preliminary study might provide useful information for 
activity recognition, e.g. in terms of detecting changes 
of user's behaviour (enthusiasm, boredom, tiredness or confusion) in 
the way in which activities are performed over the course of training, 
practice or rehabilitation.
}


\headerbox{Materials and Methods}{name=methods,column=0,below=problem}{

Raw time-series data is collected from a triaxial accelerometer ($a_x, a_y, a_z$)
and a triaxial gyroscope ($g_x, g_y, g_z$). 
Then, a $N$ samples length time-series, e.g. $a_x$, is used to obtain the
time-delay embedded matrix, $E \{ a_x \}$, with $m=20$ and $\tau=6$ \cite{frank10, sama13}.
Finally, PCA is applied to  $E \{ a_x \}$ to compute the percentage of cumulative energy \cite{nhammerla11}.
The method is applied to six simple movements 
which were performed by six participants wearing an intertial sensor on their right wrist, 
each movement were continuously repeated for 20 seconds.
}

\headerbox{Conclusion and Outlook}{name=conclusion,column=0,below=methods}{

Although the time-delay embedding technique is
subject to different values of embedded parameters ($m$
and $\tau$) according to 
the length and complexity of the time-series \cite{sama13}, 
the framework is useful for statistically
presenting the inherent features of variability 
of simplistic gestures.
Appreciating variability in human activity can not only
provide useful diagnostic information but also offers an
approach to considering the manner in which people
interact with pervasive displays.

In the future, we will collect data from a wider range of individuals
(gender and age) and from additional sensors. Also, 
different classification techniques will be explored.

The values of percentage of cumulative energy (PCE) are presented for
triaxial accelerometer (ACC) and triaxial gyroscope (GYR) sensors 
accross partipants and their average denoted by ``avg''. 

It is apparent that circular and 8-shape movements show a constant 
trend between participants; however, such a trend is not evident for 
the other movements.
We assume that the evident variability for the static, horizontal, vertical and diagonal movements
is due to the flexibility in the experiment where participants
were only asked to perform the movements at a comfortable speed.
