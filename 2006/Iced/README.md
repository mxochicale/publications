A New Method for Design Narrow Band Lowpass FIR Filters Using a Scale Function
----------------------
#### Abstract:
A simple method for design of computationally efficient
finite impulse (FIR) lowpass filter is presented. The
design method is based on the sharpening and rounding
techniques. At first, the filter which satisfies the
specification is designed by Remez algoritm. In the next
step the filter coefficients are rounded to the nearest
integers. The sharpening technique is applied to the
rounded filter to improve the magnitude characteristic
and to satisfy the specification. In order to get less
complex filter the proposed scale function is used.
