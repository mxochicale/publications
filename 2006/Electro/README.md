One Method for Design of Wide-band FIR Filters using Frequency Masking Method with Rounding and Sharpening
----------------------
#### Abstract:
This paper presents a modification of the
Frequency Masking Method (FMM) proposed by Yong
Ching Lim for Wide-band FIR filters with less multipliers.
This method is based on the masking method reducing the
complexity, using IFIR filter instead of model filter and
applying the rounding and sharpening techniques in all
subfilters. The coefficient values of the IFIR and masking
filters are represented as integers using the rounding
technique. The sharpening technique is applied to
improve the magnitude response of rounded IFIR filter
and rounded masking filters. Our proposal is to use a set
of round constant and sharpening technique to satisfy the
overall magnitude characteristics.
