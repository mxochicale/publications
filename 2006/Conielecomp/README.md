One Method for Design of Wide-band FIR Filters Without Multipliers
----------------------
#### Abstract:
This paper presents the method for the wide-band
FIR filters design without multipliers. The proposed
method is based on the masking method and the
techniques for rounding and sharpening. The
coefficient values of the model and masking filters are
represented as integers using the rounding technique.
The sharpening technique is applied to the masking
filters to improve the overall magnitude characteristic
and to satisfy the given specification.
