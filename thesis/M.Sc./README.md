Design of digital filters with fewer multipliers
---

# Abstract:
In this thesis two methods for reducing the number of multipliers in FIR
(Finite Impulse Response) filters are presented. These two proposed methods
are based on modifications on the IFIR (Interpolated FIR) and FMM
(Frequency Masking Method) structures. By using rounding and sharpening techniques
and the scaling function, the number of multipliers can be reduced. The rounding
and sharpening techniques used here have been studied and employed in
the literature, while this thesis employs the scaling function for the first time.
With the aim of demonstrating the proposed methods in this thesis, three
applications are presented: 1) a noise reductor in vocal frequencies,
2) a transmultiplexor and 3) a sigma delta A/D converter.
In the Appendix, the MATLAB functions used for this work are described, as
well as the published articles describing the methods proposed.
